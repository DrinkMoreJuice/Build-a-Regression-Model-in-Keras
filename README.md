# Build-a-Regression-Model-in-Keras
Build a Regression Model in Keras - Final Assesment for IBM's AI Engineering Course - Introduction to Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks with Keras

This is the assesment i did for IBM's Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras

There are 4 files (A), (B), (C), (D) for each of the assesment questions.

In this project, I build a regression model using the Keras library to model data about concrete compressive strength.
The data can be found here: https://cocl.us/concrete_data or in this github repository.
